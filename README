This is a puppet module for installing, configuring and starting MYSQL Server and deploying databases and user accounts.

NOTE: This module was mainly tested on RHEL/CentOS 5 using puppet 2.6.x

* Requirements:
- mysql, mysql-server RPM's availble via Yum repository.
- puppet ( 2.6+ recommended) installed on all servers

Usage:
1. Define the following in mysql::params:
	- Mysql server root user password
2. Add the required classes to nodes in pupppet
3. Run puppet on the rest of the nodes

Example usage:

node "localhost.localdomain" {
        
	#This installs the mysql and mysql server software.
	include mysql::server

	#This creates the user candy and the databbase 
        mysql::populate{'testdatabase':
                user         => 'bob',
                userpass     => 'laser#1',
                databasename => 'testdatabase',
        }
}
